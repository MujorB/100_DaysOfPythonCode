---------------- Number Guessing Game Todo ---------------------------
######################################################################
SelfNote: Bright please note that each #todo task does not necessarily means it is done linearly,
          some can be left to be implemented later.

#1. Display the welcome message: **checked**
        display game_art_logo
        display message_1 = "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!!"


#2. Game number guessing implementation:  **checked**
        display message_2 = "I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100"
        implementation:
            >> Choosing and storing a random number between 1 and 100
            >> random_number = any number between 1 and 100


#3. Prompting player for game difficulty:  **checked**
        prompt game_level = "Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': "
        implementation:
            if game_level == easy
                >> count_down = 5
                >> message_3 = "You have {count_down} attempts remaining to guess the number."
            while
            if game_level == hard 
                >> count_down = 10
                >> display message_3 = "You have {count_down} attempts remaining to guess the number."


#4. Prompting player for "Guess" and checking if "Guess" is equal to random_number?:
        prompt player_guess = "Make a guess: "
            if player_guess is greater than random_number
                >> display message_4 = "Too high.{newline}Guess again."
                >> reduce the count_down score by one
                >> display message_3
            else if player_guess is less than random_number
                >> display message_5 = "Too low.{newline}Guess again."
                >> still reduce the count_down score by one
                >> display message_3
            else if player_guess is equal to random_number
                >> display message_6 = "You Won :) , the actual answer was {random_number} :)"
                >> #end_game

        
#5. Terminating the game:
        Reasons for game termination(#end_game) include:
            - if player wins i.e player_guess is equal to random_number 
            - if player count_down is equal to zero. 
        .b if player count_down is equal to zero.
            >> display message_7 = "Sorry all attempts has been used, You Lose :("
            >> #end_game


#6. Asking user for game replay:
        prompt play_again = "Would you love to play Number Guessing Game again? Type 'y' or 'n': "
